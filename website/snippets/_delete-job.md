To delete a job or multiple jobs in dbt Cloud:

1. Click **Deploy** on the navigation header.
2. Click **Jobs** and select the job you want to delete. 
3. Click **Settings** on the top right of the page and then click **Edit**.
4. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click **Delete** to delete the job. <br />

5. Confirm your action in the pop-up by clicking **Confirm delete** in the bottom right to delete the job immediately. This action cannot be undone. However, you can create a new job with the same information if the deletion was made in error. 
6. Refresh the page, and the deleted job should now be gone. If you want to delete multiple jobs, you'll need to perform these steps for each job.

If you're having any issues, feel free to [contact us](mailto:support@getdbt.com) for additional help.
