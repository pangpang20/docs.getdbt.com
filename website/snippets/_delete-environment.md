Deleting an environment automatically deletes its associated job(s). If you want to keep those jobs, move them to a different environment first. 

Follow these steps to delete an environment in dbt Cloud:

1. Click **Deploy** on the navigation header and then click **Environments**
2. Select the environment you want to delete. 
3. Click **Settings** on the top right of the page and then click **Edit**.
4. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click **Delete** to delete the environment.

5. Confirm your action in the pop-up by clicking **Confirm delete** in the bottom right to delete the environment immediately. This action cannot be undone. However, you can create a new environment with the same information if the deletion was made in error.
6. Refresh your page and the deleted environment should now be gone. To delete multiple environments, you'll need to perform these steps to delete each one.
