# Data health signals <Lifecycle status="preview" />
Data health signals offer a quick, at-a-glance view of data health when browsing your resources in dbt Explorer. They keep you informed on the status of your resource's health using the indicators **Healthy**, **Caution**, **Degraded**, or **Unknown**.

- Supported resources are [models](/docs/build/models), [sources](/docs/build/sources), and [exposures](/docs/build/exposures).
- For accurate health data, ensure the resource is up-to-date and had a recent job run.
- Each data health signal reflects key data health components, such as test success status, missing resource descriptions, missing tests, absence of builds in 30-day windows, [and more](#data-health-signal-criteria)

## Access data health signals

Access data health signals in the following places:
- In the [search function](/docs/collaborate/explore-projects#search-resources) or under **Models**, **Sources**, or **Exposures** in the **Resource** tab.  
  - For sources, the data health signal also indicates the [source freshness](/docs/deploy/source-freshness) status.
- In the **Health** column on [each resource's details page](/docs/collaborate/explore-projects#view-resource-details). Hover over or click the signal to view detailed information.
- In the **Health** column of public models tables.
- In the [DAG lineage graph](/docs/collaborate/explore-projects#project-lineage). Click any node to open the node details panel where you can view it and its details.
- In [Data health tiles](/docs/collaborate/data-tile) through an embeddable iFrame and visible in your BI dashboard.

## Data health signal criteria

Each resource has a health state that is determined by specific set of criteria. Select the following tabs to view the criteria for that resource type.
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="models" label="Models">

The health state of a model is determined by the following criteria:
<!-- TODO: remove the 'tbd' lines in the table once meta 4025 is done -->
| **Health state** | **Criteria**   |
|-------------------|---------------|
| âœ… **Healthy**    | All of the following must be true:<br /><br /> - Built successfully in the last run<br />- Built in the last 30 days<br />- Model has tests configured<br />- All tests passed<br />- All upstream [sources are fresh](/docs/build/sources#source-data-freshness) or freshness is not applicable (set to `null`)<br />- Has a description |

| ðŸ”´ **Degraded**  | One of the following must be true: <br /><br />- Model failed to build<br />- Model has failing tests<br />- One or more upstream sources are stale:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Freshness check hasnâ€™t run in the past 30 days<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Freshness check returned an error |
| âšª **Unknown**    | - Unable to determine health of resource; no job runs have processed the resource.         |

<!-- TODO: Add source collection health once META-3973/3971 are completed 
<TabItem value="source-collection" label="Source collection health">

The health state of a source collection is determined by the following criteria:
