Available in the [dbt Cloud "Latest" release track](/docs/dbt-versions/cloud-release-tracks) and dbt Core v1.9 and higher.

## Definition

Set the `lookback` to an integer greater than or equal to zero. The default value is `1`.  You can configure `lookback` for a [model](/docs/build/models) in your `dbt_project.yml` file, property YAML file, or config block.

## Examples

The following examples set `2` as the `lookback` config for the `user_sessions` model.

Example in the `dbt_project.yml` file:

<File name='dbt_project.yml'>

```yml
models:
  my_project:
    user_sessions:
      +lookback: 2
```
</File>

Example in a properties YAML file:

<File name='models/properties.yml'>

```yml
models:
  - name: user_sessions
    config:
      lookback: 2
```

</File>

Example in sql model config block:

<File name="models/user_sessions.sql">

```sql
{{ config(
    lookback=2
) }}
```

</File>
