If you were guided to this page from a data platform setup article, it most likely means:

- Setting up the profile is the only action the end-user needs to take on the data platform, or
- The subsequent actions the end-user needs to take are not currently documented, or
- Relevant information is provided on the documentation pages of the data platform vendor.

If you'd like to contribute to data platform-specific configuration information, refer to [Documenting a new adapter](/guides/adapter-creation)
